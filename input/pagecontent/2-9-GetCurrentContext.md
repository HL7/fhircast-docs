{% include questionnote.html text='Implementer feedback is solicited on the GetCurrentContext operation.' %}

In some situations, Subscribers may want to verify the current context. This section defines a method in which the current context can be retrieved using a GET call. The Hub responds to this GET request with the most recently communicated open event. 

Hubs MAY support returning the current context of a session, as defined below.

### Get Current Context Request

The requester makes an HTTP GET call to the following URL:

GET `base-hub-URL/{topic}`

### Get Current Context Response

This method returns an object containing the current context of a topic; where the current context is the most recent *-open event according to the Subscriber's subscription.  The current context is made up of one or more "top-level" contextual resources and the type of the anchor context SHALL be in the `context.type` field.  For example, if the current context was established using a [`Patient-open`](3-3-1-Patient-open.html) request the returned object will contain `context.type: "Patient"`.  If the current context was created by a [`DiagnosticReport-open`](3-6-1-DiagnosticReport-open.html) request the returned object will contain `context.type: "DiagnosticReport"`.  If there is no context currently established, the `context.type` SHALL contain an empty string and the `context` SHALL be an empty array.

If an established context is closed without another being opened, the Hub SHALL return an empty context (which as specified above is indicated by returning an empty string for the `context.type` and an empty array in `context`).  See [Multi-tab Considerations](4-4-multitab-considerations.html) for additional discussion on multiple context scenarios.

{:.grid}
Field | Optionality | Type | Description
----- | --- | --- | ---
`context.type` | Required | string | ResourceType of the context element or an empty string if no context is currently established.
`context.versionId` | Required | string | The versionId of the current context. Each time the context changes, a different versionId is generated.
`context`   | Required | array | The context array of the corresponding context element as was supplied in the most recent `-open` event or an empty array if no context is currently established.

### Content Sharing Support

If a Hub supports content sharing, the Hub returns the current content in a `content` key in the `context` array.  There SHALL be one and only one `Bundle` resource which SHALL have a `type` of `collection`.  No entry in the `Bundle` shall contain a `request` attribute.  The `Bundle` SHALL contain no entries if there is no content associated with the current context.

#### Context

{:.grid}
Key | Optionality | FHIR operation to generate context | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`content` | REQUIRED if content sharing is supported | not applicable | Current content of the anchor context or a `Bundle` resource with no entries if no content is associated with the current context. The `Bundle` resource SHALL conform to the [FHIRcast get current content Bundle](StructureDefinition-fhircast-get-current-content-bundle.html) profile.

### Examples

#### Get Context Response Example

The following example shows a response to the get context request when the current context was created by a [`DiagnosticReport-open`](3-6-1-DiagnosticReport-open.html) request.  The response contains version "023fe970-a6d9-442f-a499-dfb71f1edba6" of the anchor context's content which contains a single `Observation` resource.
