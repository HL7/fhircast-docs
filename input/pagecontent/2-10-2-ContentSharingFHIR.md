In this approach, a FHIR server is used to synchronized content between different FHIRcast Subscribers. This is illustrated in the figure below.

Each Subscriber uses FHIRcast to exchange context. The common FHIR server is used to align on content using the [RESTful API](https://build.fhir.org/http) defined by FHIR. Typically this is the server used in a [SMART on FHIR launch](4-1-launch-scenarios.html).

In this deployment, the FHIR server acts independently from the FHIRcast Hub.

Notifications on content changes are supported using the [FHIR subscription mechanism](https://build.fhir.org/subscriptions.html).
