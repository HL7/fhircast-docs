### Event-name: SyncError

eventMaturity | [2 - Tested](3-1-2-eventmaturitymodel.html)

### Workflow

A synchronization error has been detected and this is indicated to Subscribers. 

Unlike most of FHIRcast events, `SyncError` is an infrastructural event and does not follow the `FHIR-resource`-`[open|close]` syntax and is directly referenced in the [underlying specification](2_Specification.html).

A `SyncError` is sent by a Subscriber when:
1. It responds to a context change event with a 202 indicating the context change is accepted but has not yet occurred, and later the Subscriber decides to refuse the context (see: [`Event Notification Response`](2-5-EventNotification.html#event-notification-response)). 

In these events the field `issue.severity` is SHALL be set to `warning` as is specified in [Operation outcome for Subscriber generated sync-errors](StructureDefinition-fhircast-subscriber-operation-outcome-syncerrror.html). `SyncError` is not used when a Subscriber responds to an `*-update` or `*-select` event.


A `SyncError` is broadcast by the Hub when one of the following conditions occur:
1. A Subscriber encounters an error when following a context, returning a server error (50X) to the Hub (see: [`Event Notification Response`](2-5-EventNotification.html#event-notification-response)).
2. A Subscriber decides not to follow a context, returning a server conflict (409) to the Hub (see: [`Event Notification Response`](2-5-EventNotification.html#event-notification-response)).
3. The Hub detects a connection issue with a Subscriber (see: [`Hub Generated SyncError Events`](2-5-EventNotification.html#hub-generated-syncerror-events)).

In these events the field `issue.severity` SHALL beset to `warning` as is specified in [Operation outcome for Hub generated sync-errors](StructureDefinition-fhircast-hub-operation-outcome-syncerrror.html).


### Context
 
The `context` array SHALL contain a single FHIR OperationOutcome based on the profile [Operation outcome for sync-errors](StructureDefinition-fhircast-operation-outcome-syncerror.html).
