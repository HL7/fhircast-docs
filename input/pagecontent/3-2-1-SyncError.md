### Event-name: SyncError

eventMaturity | [2 - Tested](3-1-2-eventmaturitymodel.html)

### Workflow

A synchronization error has been detected and this is indicated to Subscribers. 

Unlike most of FHIRcast events, `SyncError` is an infrastructural event and does not follow the `FHIR-resource`-`[open|close]` syntax and is directly referenced in the [underlying specification](2_Specification.html).

A `syncerror` is sent by a Subscriber when:
1. It responds to a context change event with a 202 indicating the context change is accepted but has not yet occurred, and later the Subscriber decides to refuse the context (see: [`Event Notification Response`](2-5-EventNotification.html#event-notification-response)) - the `severity` of the `operationoutcome` resource in the `syncerror` SHALL be `warning`

A `syncerror` is broadcast by the Hub when one of the following conditions occur:
1. A Subscriber encounters an error when following a context, returning a server error (50X) to the Hub (see: [`Event Notification Response`](2-5-EventNotification.html#event-notification-response)) - the `severity` of the `operationoutcome` resource in the `syncerror` SHALL be `information`
2. A Subscriber decides not to follow a context, returning a server conflict (409) to the Hub (see: [`Event Notification Response`](2-5-EventNotification.html#event-notification-response)) - the `severity` of the `operationoutcome` resource in the `syncerror` SHALL be `information`
3. The Hub detects a connection issue with a Subscriber (see: [`Hub Generated syncerror Events`](2-5-EventNotification.html#hub-generated-syncerror-events)) - the `severity` of the `operationoutcome` resource shall be `information`

### Context

The `context` array SHALL contain a single FHIR OperationOutcome.

{:.grid}
Key | Optionality | FHIR operation to generate context | Description
----- | -------- | ---- | ----
`operationoutcome` | REQUIRED | `OperationOutcome` | FHIR resource describing an outcome of an unsuccessful system action.

Content of the OperationOutcome resource SHALL be at least one `issue` with the initial `issue` containing:
* `issue[0].severity` as per the above workflow section
* `issue[0].code` of `processing`
* `issue[0].details` SHALL be present
* `issue[0].details.coding` SHALL contain at least three codings, differentiated by their system:
  * `issue[0].details.coding` SHALL contain a coding with the id of the event that this error is related to as a `code` with the `system` value of "https://fhircast.hl7.org/events/syncerror/eventid"
  * `issue[0].details.coding` SHALL contain a coding with the name of the relevant event with a `system` value of "https://fhircast.hl7.org/events/syncerror/eventname" 
  * `issue[0].details.coding` SHALL contain a coding with the optional `subscriber.name` attribute of the original subscription of the relevant Subscriber with a `system` value of "https://fhircast.hl7.org/events/syncerror/subscriber"; the `code` attribute MAY be an empty string if no `subscriber.name` of the relevant Subscriber was provided in the original subscription
  * additional `coding` elements MAY be included with different `system` values to provide extra information about the `syncerror`
* `issue[0].diagnostics` attribute SHALL contain a human readable explanation on the source and reason for the error.
