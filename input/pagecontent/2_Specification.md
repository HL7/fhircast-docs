The FHIRcast specification describes the APIs used to synchronize disparate healthcare applications' user interfaces in real time, allowing them to show the same clinical context and content to a user (or group of users).

Once an application [knows about](2-1-SessionDiscovery.html) the session (Hub topic), the application [subscribes](2-4-Subscribing.html) to specific workflow-related [events](2-3-Events.html) for the given session. The application is then [notified](2-5-EventNotification.html) when those workflow-related events occur; for example, when the clinician opens a patient's chart in another application subscribed to the same session. A Subscriber may also [initiate context changes](2-6-RequestContextChange.html) by accessing APIs defined in this specification; for example, closing the patient's chart. A Subscriber [unsubscribes from the session](2-4-Subscribing.html#unsubscribe) to no longer receive session events. The notification events describing the workflow event are defined as a simple JSON wrapper around one or more FHIR resources.

FHIRcast recommends the [HL7 SMART on FHIR launch protocol](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch) for both session discovery and API authentication. FHIRcast enables a Subscriber to receive notifications over a WebSocket connection. This protocol is modeled on the [W3C WebSub RFC](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/), such as its use of GET vs POST interactions and a Hub for managing subscriptions. The Hub exposes APIs for subscribing and unsubscribing, requesting context changes, sharing content, and distributing event notifications. The flow diagram presented below illustrates the series of interactions specified by FHIRcast, their origination, and their outcome.

All data exchanged through the HTTP APIs SHALL be formatted, sent, and received as [JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) structures (unless otherwise specified), and SHALL be transmitted over channels secured using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS), also known as HTTPS which is defined in [RFC2818](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818).

All data exchanged through WebSockets SHALL be formatted, sent, and received as [JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) structures, and SHALL be transmitted over Secure Web Sockets (WSS) as defined in [RFC6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).
