The FHIRcast specification can be described as a set of capabilities and any specific FHIRcast Hub may implement a subset of these capabilities. A FHIRcast Hub declares support for FHIRcast and specific capabilities by exposing an extension on the FHIR CapabilityStatement resource as described below. 


### Wellknown Endpoint

To support various architectures, including multiple decentralized FHIRcast hubs, the Hub exposes a `.well-known` endpoint containing additional information about the capabilities of that Hub. A Hub's supported events, version, and other capabilities can be exposed as a Well-Known Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) ([RFC5785](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785)) JSON document.

Hubs SHOULD serve a JSON document at the location formed by appending `/.well-known/fhircast-configuration` to their `hub.url`. Contrary to RFC5785 Appendix B.4, the `.well-known` path component may be appended even if the `hub.url` endpoint already contains a path component.

A simple JSON document is returned using the `application/json` mime type, with the following key/value pairs:

{:.grid}
Field              | Optionality | Type  | Description
------------------ | ----------- | ----- | ---
`eventsSupported`  | Required    | array | Array of FHIRcast events supported by the Hub.
`websocketSupport` | Required    | boolean | SHALL have the static value: `true` - indicating support for websockets.
`fhircastVersion`  | Optional | string | `STU1`, `STU2`, or `STU3` - indicating support for a specific version of FHIRcast. Hubs SHOULD indicate the version of FHIRcast supported.
`getCurrentSupport` | Optional | boolean | `true` or `false` - indicating support for the "[Get Current Context](2-9-GetCurrentContext.html)" API.
`fhirVersion`  | Optional | string | `DSTU1`, `DSTU2`, `STU3`, `R4`, `R4B`, or `R5` - indicating the specific version of FHIR for this Hub.

A field of `webhookSupport` SHALL be ignored.

#### Wellknown endpoint discovery example

In this example the Hub URL is "www.hub.example.com/".

##### Wellknown endpoint discovery Request

```text
GET /.well-known/fhircast-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: www.hub.example.com
```

#### Wellknown endpoint discovery Response

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "eventsSupported": ["Patient-open", "Patient-close", "SyncError", "com.example.researchstudy-transmogrify"],
  "websocketSupport": true,
  "fhircastVersion": "STU3"
}
```

### FHIR Capability Statement

To supplement or optionally identify the location of a FHIRcast hub, a FHIR server MAY declare support for FHIRcast using the FHIRcast extension on its FHIR CapabilityStatement's `rest` element. Note that client-side Hubs without a client-side FHIR server likely will not support communicating the url of a hub in this extension. See [the FHIRcast CapabilityStatement profile](StructureDefinition-fhircast-capabilitystatement.html).

### FHIR Resource Structures

FHIRcast defines profiles for various FHIR resource structures used in the specification, see [`summary of artifacts`](artifacts.html).

#### Must Support

In the context of FHIRcast, must support (MS) on any data element SHALL be interpreted to mean [FHIRâ€™s MustSupport](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport). Generally, implementations are expected to:
* if known and possible, populate supported data elements as part of the event notifications as specified by the FHIRcast profiles.
* interpret missing, supported data elements within resource instances as data not present in the sending systems (or for which the requestor is unauthorized).
