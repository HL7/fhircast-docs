{:.grid}
Key | Cardinality | FHIR operation to generate context | Description
----- | -------- | ---- | ---- 
`patient` | 1..1 | `Patient/{id}?_elements=identifier` | FHIR Patient resource describing the patient previously in context that is being closed.

The following profiles provide guidance as to which resource attributes should be present and considerations as to how each attribute should be valued in a Patient close request:

* [Patient for Close Events](StructureDefinition-fhircast-patient-close.html)

Other attributes of the Patient resource (or resource extensions) may be present in the provided resource; however, attributes not called out in the profile are not required by the FHIRcast standard.
