<!-- ## Session Discovery -->

A session is an abstract concept representing a shared workspace, such as user's login session over multiple applications or a shared view of one application distributed to multiple users. FHIRcast requires a session to have a unique and opaque identifier. This identifier is exchanged as the value of the `hub.topic` parameter. Before establishing a subscription, an application must know the `hub.topic` and the `hub.url` which contains the base URL of the Hub.

Systems SHOULD use SMART on FHIR to authorize, authenticate, and exchange initial shared context. If using SMART, following a [SMART on FHIR EHR launch](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch#ehr-launch-sequence) or [SMART on FHIR standalone launch](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#standalone-launch-sequence), the application SHALL request and, if authorized, SHALL be granted one or more [FHIRcast OAuth 2.0 scopes](2-2-FhircastScopes.html). Accompanying this scope grant, the authorization server SHALL supply the `hub.url` and `hub.topic` SMART launch parameters alongside the access token and other parameters appropriate to establish initial shared context. Per SMART, when the `openid` scope is granted, the authorization server additionally sends the current user's identity in an `id_token`.

Although FHIRcast works best with the SMART on FHIR launch and authorization process, implementation-specific launch, authentication, and authorization protocols may be possible. If not using SMART on FHIR, the mechanism enabling the application to discover the `hub.url` and `hub.topic` is not defined in FHIRcast. See [other launch scenarios](4-1-launch-scenarios.html#alternate-application-launch) for guidance.
