### Event-name: userlogout

eventMaturity | [1 - Submitted](3-1-2-eventmaturitymodel.html)

### Workflow

User's session has ended, perhaps by exiting the Subscriber through a logout, session time-out or other reason. 

Unlike most of FHIRcast events, `userlogout` is a statically named event and therefore does not follow the `FHIR-resource`-`[open|close]` syntax.

Implementers are encouraged to consider if and when their application should logout the user upon receiving an userLogout event, and if so, how to preserve application state.

### Context

The context is empty.

### Examples

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-11-25T13:16:00.00",
  "id": "35d0b1d4-de45-4b5b-a0e9-9c51b21ee71a",
  "event": {
    "hub.topic": "fdb2f928-5546-4f52-87a0-0648e9ded065", 
    "hub.event": "userLogout", 
    "context": [] 
  }
}
```
