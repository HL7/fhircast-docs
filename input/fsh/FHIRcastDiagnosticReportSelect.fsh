Title: "FHIRcast Diagnostic Report for Select Events"
Description:
"""
Provides guidance as to which `DiagnosticReport` attributes should be present and considerations as to how each attribute should be valued in [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) events.

The `DiagnosticReport` in [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) events enables verification that the selected content in the [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) event belongs to the DiagnosticReport which is the current anchor context.

Hence, the only required attributes of `DiagnosticReport` in the [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) event is the resources' `id`, as well as its `status` and `code` since these attributes are required by FHIR.  Other attributes of the `DiagnosticReport` MAY be valued but would serve no purpose in the [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) event.

While initially the `status` of the report may begin as `unknown` or `preliminary` (or something else), throughout the lifecycle of the context the report's status may transition.  For example, a reporting application may enable a clinician to sign the report.  In such a situation this change in status could become final and would be communicated through a [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) event prior to the DiagnosticReport context being closed by a DiagnosticReport-close event.

Description: "Example of a `DiagnosticReport` which could be used in a [`DiagnosticReport-select`](3-6-4-DiagnosticReport-select.html) event.  Note that due to limitation of tools used to publishing the specification the below resource `id` is appended with '-select'.  The specification requires that the resource `id` in the [FHIR resource]-select be identical to the resource `id` provided in the corresponding [FHIR resource]-open; hence in the real world the '-select' suffix would not be present."
