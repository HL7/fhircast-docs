Title: "FHIRcast Content Update Bundle"
Description: """
    Defines the structure of a Bundle that carries content updates that are
    communicated in FHIRcast `-update` messages. The bundle can only contain
    requests of type PUT and DELETE.  
    POST is not allowed as the content sharing mechanism cannot indicate the 
    id of the created resource using a POST operation.
