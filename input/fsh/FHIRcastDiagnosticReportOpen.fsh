Title: "FHIRcast Diagnostic Report for Open Events"
Description:
"""
Provides guidance as to which DiagnosticReport attributes should be present and considerations as to how each attribute should be valued in all [FHIR resource]-open events.

At least one business identifier of the DiagnosticReport SHALL be provided in a [FHIR resource]-open request.

Typically the report is associated with an order from an information system.  In this case the accession number of the order is provided in the DiagnosticReport's `basedOn` array attribute as a reference using a ServiceRequest reference type and the “ACSN” identifier type.  The accession number SHALL be included as a business identifier if it is known.

A reporting system may also include its own identifier and should use an appropriate identifier type and system when supplying such a business identifier.

In radiology reports or other image related uses of FHIRcast, at least one imaging study would likely be the subject of the report and included in the event's context.  In this case, the reference to one or more ImagingStudy resources would be provided.

**FHIR R4 versus FHIR R5**
In the FHIR R4 DiagnosticReport resource image study references would be placed in the `imagingStudy` attribute.  In a FHIR R5 (or above) DiagnosticReport this attribute has been renamed `study` since the allowed reference types has been expanded to include references to GenomicStudy resources.  This is obviously a breaking change.

In FHIRcast deployments based on FHIR R5, the attribute `study` SHALL be used rather than the `imagingStudy` attribute.

Additionally FHIR R5 includes a `supportingInfo` attribute. While not yet formally provided for in FHIR R5, it has been recommended that the next release of FHIR allow an ImagingStudy reference be included in this attribute so that the DiagnosticReport could indicate one or more image studies were consulted during the creation of the report. As such in FHIR R5 deployments, this field is considered labeled as must support.

A logical id of the resource SHALL be provided. It may be the `id` associated with the resource as persisted in a FHIR server.

When a [FHIR resource]-close event including this report is requested, the Subscriber requesting the context be closed SHALL use the same DiagnosticReport `id` which was provided in the [FHIR resource]-open event (see also [FHIRcast DiagnosticReport for Close Events](StructureDefinition-fhircast-diagnostic-report-close.html)).
