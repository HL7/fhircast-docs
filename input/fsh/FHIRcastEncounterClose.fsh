Usage: #example
Description: "Example of an encounter which could be used in a [FHIR resource]-close event.  Note that due to limitation of tools used to publishing the specification the below resource `id` is appended with '-close'.  The specification requires that the resource `id` in the -close be identical to the resource `id` provided in the corresponding -open; hence in the real world the '-close' suffix would not be present."
