Title: "FHIRcast ImagingStudy for Open Events"
Description:
"""
Provides guidance as to which ImagingStudy attributes should be present and considerations as to how each attribute should be valued in all [FHIR resource]-open events.

At least one business identifier of the ImagingStudy SHALL be provided in a [FHIR resource]-open request.  Two business identifiers are typically associated with an image study.  Imaging systems such as a PACS viewer, advanced visualization workstation, etc. typically identify an image study by its DICOM Study Instance UID (which in DICOM is identified with a (0020,000D) tag).  Likewise, information systems often identify an image study through the accession number of the order which triggered the image procedure to be performed.

The Study Instance UID SHALL be included as a business identifier if it is known.  In FHIR, the Study Instance UID of an ImagingStudy is provided in the `identifier` array using the identifier system of `urn:dicom:uid` and prefixing the UID value with `urn:oid:`.

The accession number SHALL be included as a business identifier if it is known.

**FHIR R4 versus FHIR R5**

Relative to FHIR R4, the ImagingStudy resource's change relevant to FHIRcast is the guidance FHIR R5 provides in specifying the accession number.  In FHIR R4, the guidance is to provide the accession number in the `identifier` array.  In FHIR R5, the accession number is provided in the ImagingStudy's `basedOn` array as a reference using a ServiceRequest reference type.

Since this version of FHIRcast promotes the use of FHIR R4 resources, the guidance to provide the accession number in the `identifier` array SHOULD be used and this approach is shown in all ImagingStudy examples in the FHIRcast specification.  However, if Subscribers agree to use FHIR R5 resources, the FHIR R5 recommendation MAY be used.

For a more detailed explanation of these business identifiers, see the [FHIR R4 implementation notes of the FHIR ImagingStudy resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/imagingstudy.html) (and the [FHIR R5 implementation notes of the FHIR ImagingStudy resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/imagingstudy.html)). Ideally both the accession number and Study Instance UID are available and present in an ImagingStudy resource used in FHIRcast.  The presence of both business identifiers ensures that all Subscribers will be able to be able to identify the appropriate imaging study.

When a [FHIR resource]-close event including this image study is requested, the Subscriber requesting the context be closed SHALL use the same ImagingStudy resource `id` which was provided in the [FHIR resource]-open event (see also [FHIRcast ImagingStudy for Close Events](StructureDefinition-fhircast-imaging-study-close.html)).

A reference to the related non-Patient subject of the study SHALL be present in the ImagingStudy resource as it is required by the FHIR specification but is not required to be present in the [FHIR resource]-open event's context.  For example, a reference to a Device resource could be provided as the subject (note, if no FHIR Device FHIR resource instance is available it is allowed to provide only a `display` value in the `reference`) but not provided in the FHIRcast event's `context` array.
