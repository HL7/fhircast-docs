A definition for CodeSystem 'http://example.com/events/syncerror/your-error-code-system' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process.%

# Ignore a warning that is caused by an error in the underlying FHIR specification

# Not relevant as the non-matching slice has been put there on purpose in order to illustrate including additional information.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/fhircast/StructureDefinition/fhircast-subscriber-operation-outcome-syncerrror|3.0.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
