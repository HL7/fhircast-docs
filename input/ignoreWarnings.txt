# Not relevant as the non-matching slice has been put there on purpose in order to illustrate including additional information.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/fhircast/StructureDefinition/fhircast-subscriber-operation-outcome-syncerrror|3.0.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# The extension appears on the resource definition of CapabilityStatement in the R4 distribution and cannot be changed or effects this implementation guide.
